# Running the Examples
To run the examples provided in this repository, you'll need to setup MySQL - I recommend installing the MySQL Server + Workbench bundle. You can install these on your local machine but you can also use online platforms for practice, although you are limited on certain tools that prevent you from creating data.

# Example Execution
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the desired chapter or example script.
- Open MySQL Workbench and connect to the server.
- Copy or write the SQL code from the script file and execute it in your query editor.
